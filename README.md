## Details

### Problem Statements

- ### Part 1 - Master Theorem
  > Calculate the time complexity of the given functions using Master Theorem.

- ### Part 2 - Financial Company, Stockers
  > - The Application will accept the no of companies N, that the user wants to store records of 
  > - Users will enter the share price of N companies. 
  > - Users will enter a boolean value of each company, to keep track of the companyâ€™s share price compared to yesterday
  > - USER can perform the following operations in the application : 
       1. Display the companies stock prices in ascending order
       2. Display the companies stock prices in descending order
       3. Display the total no of companies for which stock prices rose today
       4. Display the total no of companies for which stock prices declined today
       5. Search a specific stock price //it will only display whether the stock price is present or not
       
       
### Solution Details

- ### Part 1 - Master Theorem
  > ShubhamKumarShukla_masterTheoremSolution.docx contains the solution for the Part 1 of the Problem Statement  

- ### Part 2 - Financial Company, Stockers
  > - For sorting I have used Merge Sort implementation 
  > - To find no of Companies whose stock rose or fell, I have used the Linear Search Algorithm 
  > - To find the specific stock price, I have used Binary Search Algorithm

Part 2 solution contains a Driver class which contains the `main()` method to run the program.
